--- abstract

The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) specifications apply Web
technologies to constrained environments.
One important such technology is Web Linking (RFC 8288), which CoRE
specifications use as the basis for a number of discovery protocols, such as the
Link Format (RFC 6690) in CoAP's Resource Discovery Protocol (Section 7.2
of RFC7252) and the Resource Directory (RD, RFC 9176).

Web Links can have target attributes, the names of which are not
generally coordinated by the Web Linking specification (Section 2.2 of
RFC 8288).
This document introduces an IANA registry for coordinating names of target
attributes when used in CoRE.
It updates the RD Parameters IANA Registry created by RFC 9176 to coordinate with
this registry.

Introduction        {#intro}
============


The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) specifications apply Web
technologies to constrained environments.
One important such technology is Web Linking {{-linking}}, which CoRE
specifications use as the basis for a number of discovery protocols, such as the
Link Format {{-link-format}} in CoAP's Resource Discovery Protocol ({{Section 7.2
of -coap}}) and the Resource Directory {{-rd}}.

Web Links can have target attributes.
The original Web Linking specification ({{Section 3 of -linking-old}}) did not attempt
to coordinate names of target attributes except for providing common
target attributes for use in the Link HTTP header.
The current revision of that specification clarifies ({{Section 2.2 of -linking}}):

{:quote}
>    This specification does not attempt to coordinate the name of target
   attributes, their cardinality, or use.  Those creating and
   maintaining serialisations SHOULD coordinate their target attributes
   to avoid conflicts in semantics or syntax and MAY define their own
   registries of target attributes.

This document introduces an IANA registry for coordinating names of target
attributes when used in CoRE, with
specific instructions for the Designated Expert for this registry ({{de-instructions}}).
It updates the RD Parameters IANA Registry created by {{-rd}} to coordinate with
this registry.

With a registry now available, registration of target attributes is strongly encouraged.
The incentive is that an unregistered attribute name might be registered with a different meaning at any time.

IANA Considerations
===================

This specification creates a new Target Attributes registry in
the "Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Parameters" registry group {{!IANA.core-parameters}}, with the policy
"Expert Review" ({{Section 4.5 of -ianacons}}).

## Instructions for the Designated Expert {#de-instructions}

The expert is requested to guide the registrant towards reasonably
short target attribute names where the shortness will help conserve
resources in constrained systems, but also to be frugal in the
allocation of very short names, keeping them in reserve for
applications that are likely to enjoy wide use and can make good use
of their shortness.

The expert is also instructed to direct the registrant to provide a
specification ({{Section 4.6 of -ianacons}}), but can make exceptions,
for instance when a specification is not available at the time of
registration but is likely forthcoming.

Any questions or issues that might interest a wider audience might be
raised by the expert on the core-parameters@ietf.org mailing list for
a time-limited discussion.
This might include security considerations, or opportunities for
orchestration, e.g., when different names with similar intent are
being or could be registered.

If the expert becomes aware of target attributes that are deployed and
in use, they may also initiate a registration on their own if
they deem such a registration can avert potential future collisions.


## Structure of Entries

Each entry in the registry must include:

{:vspace}
Attribute Name:
: a lower case ASCII {{-ascii}} string that starts with a letter and can
  contain digits and hyphen-minus characters afterward
  (`[a-z][-a-z0-9]*`).
  (Note that {{-linking}} requires target attribute names to be
  interpreted in a case-insensitive way; the restriction to lower case
  here ensures that they are registered in a predictable form).

Brief description:
: a brief description

Change Controller:
: see {{Section 2.3 of -ianacons}}

Reference:
: a reference document that provides a description of the target
  attribute, including the semantics for when the target attribute
  appears more than once in a link.

## Initial Entries

Initial entries in this registry are listed in {{pre-reg}}.

{: #pre-reg title="Initial Entries in the Target Attributes Registry"}

A number of names are reserved as they are used for parameters in
links other than target attributes.
A further set of target attributes is predefined in {{-linking}} and is
imported into this registry.

{{Section 9.3 of RFC9176}} created the "RD Parameters" IANA registry.
This document requests IANA to add the following note to that registry:

> Note: In accordance with [this document], all entries with the "A" flag set, including new ones, MUST also be registered in the "Target Attributes" registry {{!IANA.core-parameters}}.

Security considerations
=======================

The security considerations of {{-linking}} apply, as do those of the
discovery specifications {{-link-format}}, {{-coap}}, and {{-rd}}.

Acknowledgements
================
{: numbered="no"}

The CoRE WG had been discussing setting up a registry for target
attributes since the final touches were made on {{-link-format}}.
The update of the Web Linking specification to {{-linking}} provided the
formal setting, but it took until {{{Jaime Jiménez}}} provided the set of
initial registrations to generate a first version of this specification.
The current version addresses additional input and working group last
call comments by
{{{Esko Dijk}}},
{{{Marco Tiloca}}},
{{{Thomas Fossati}}},
and
{{{Mohamed Boucadair}}},
as well as area director review comments from
{{{Rob Wilton}}}.
